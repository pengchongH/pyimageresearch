# LIGHTING!!! the most important factor
# lighting conditions' three primary goals
# High Contrast
# Generalizable
# Stable

# Tip:
# Strive as much as possible to obtain your ideal lighting conditions before you even write a single line of code.
# Itâ€™s substantially more beneficial (and easier) to control (or at least acknowledge) your lighting conditions than it is to write code to compensate for inferior lighting.
