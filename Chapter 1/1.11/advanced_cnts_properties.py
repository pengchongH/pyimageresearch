# Advanced contours properties
# always consider contours before more advanced computer vision and machine learning methods


# Aspect Ratio
# aspect ratio = image width / image height

# Extent
# extent = shape area(contour area) / bounding box area
# USE: distinguish between various shapes in images

# Convex Hull
# A convex hull is the smallest possible convex set that contains X points which belong to a set in Euclidean space.
# like a mathematical rubber band
# convexity defect: If a curve is not bulged out
# USE: 1. hand gesture recognition
#      2. compute solidity

# Solidity
# solidity = contour area / convex hull area
# USE: distinguish between various objects
